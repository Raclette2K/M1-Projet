Projet M1 2021-2022

## Code guidelines

Please use the .clang-format at the root of this git to ***properly*** format the code, it does the job automatically for you, you have no excuse to not use it.

### From VSCode

`Alt+Shift+F` should work by default

### From command line

```sh
clang-format -i <file>
# Or
clang-format -i *
```
