## xPlain Mini

You can find the xc8 compiler from the Microchip website at this link: (https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers)[https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-xc-compilers]  
The folder `atmega328p` provides a Makefile to help you compile for the xplain mini and also upload the binary file to the card.
