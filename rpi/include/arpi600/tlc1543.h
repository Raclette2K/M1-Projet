 * 
 * (c) Pierre Boisselier
 * 
 * This library allows one to use the TLC1543 10-bit ADC from Texas Instruments in their project.
 * The communication is done using a simple serial protocol.
 * Please refer to https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tlc1543.pdf for more informations
 * 
 * ARPI600 Implementation specific:
 *      - Set the REF jumper to either 5V or 3.3V
 *      - Connect the T_A0 pin with a jumper (TODO: Provide ways to change the input pin)
